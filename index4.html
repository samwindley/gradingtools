                <h2>Giving students a voice when creating teams</h2>
        <p>In lieu of a final exam, the second-year course (Practical English IV) would conclude with a "team presentation".</p>
        <p>Before creating teams, we used a tool called <a href="https://clevergroups.com/" target="_blank">Clever 
            Groups</a> to collect students' preferences about who they would like to work with.</p>
        <p>When students followed the Clever Groups link we gave them, they were asked to select their first name 
            (and an initial where necessary to distinguish between students with the same first name)
            from a list of students in the class.</p>
        <p>After a student selects their name, they see a dropdown menu containing the names of all their classmates and they are asked to choose their first preference
            (the student they most want to work with). Students can select as many preferences as they like (even zero).</p>
        <p>After all students have had an opportunity to enter their preferences, we log in to
            Clever Groups and ask the site to generate teams given certain parameters (maximum team size, number of teams, etc.). Clever Groups then uses an algorithm to identify
            the optimum allocation of students to teams (i.e., the allocation that best fits student preferences).
        </p>
        <p>We could even have triggered this team allocation in front of the students, during class, to demonstrate
            that we were not adjusting the allocation to suit our personal preferences, etc.

                <h2>Collecting student grading preferences</h2>
        <p>The next step was to ask students questions about their presentation grading preferences, 
            such as which aspects of a presentation they think should affect their grade, 
            and who they trust to give them a fair grade.</p>
        <p>Students were already familiar with <em>Kahoot!</em> from other classroom activities so we used a <em>Kahoot!</em> quiz (polls and scales) to pose the questions.
        We asked students about the importance of the following:<ul>
            <li>preparation</li>
            <li>slides</li>
            <li>speaking loudly and clearly</li>
            <li>presentation length</li>
            <li>being entertaining</li>
            <li>choosing an interesting topic</li>
            <li>how cohesive the team's presentation is overall</li>
            <li>grading other students fairly</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>We also asked students about how they wanted to grade other students. Specifically, we asked them about:
            <ul>
                <li>mechanics: online or on-paper</li>
                <li>timing: during the presentations or afterwards</li>
                <li>composition: one score for the whole team or separate scores per speaker</li>
                <li>scaffolding: whether they wanted us to provide a rubric or not</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <p>Finally, we asked students about how much they trusted the following people to give them a fair grade:
            <ul>
                <li>The teacher</li>
                <li>Their teammates</li>
                <li>Their classmates</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Collecting student grading preferences</h2>
        <p>The next step was to ask students questions about their presentation grading preferences, 
            such as which aspects of a presentation they think should affect their grade, 
            and who they trust to give them a fair grade.</p>
        <p>Students were already familiar with <em>Kahoot!</em> from other classroom activities so we used a <em>Kahoot!</em> quiz (polls and scales) to pose the questions.
        We asked students about the importance of the following:<ul>
            <li>preparation</li>
            <li>slides</li>
            <li>speaking loudly and clearly</li>
            <li>presentation length</li>
            <li>being entertaining</li>
            <li>choosing an interesting topic</li>
            <li>how cohesive the team's presentation is overall</li>
            <li>grading other students fairly</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>We also asked students about how they wanted to grade other students. Specifically, we asked them about:
            <ul>
                <li>mechanics: online or on-paper</li>
                <li>timing: during the presentations or afterwards</li>
                <li>composition: one score for the whole team or separate scores per speaker</li>
                <li>scaffolding: whether they wanted us to provide a rubric or not</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <p>Finally, we asked students about how much they trusted the following people to give them a fair grade:
            <ul>
                <li>The teacher</li>
                <li>Their teammates</li>
                <li>Their classmates</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                <h2>Giving students a voice when creating teams</h2>
        <p>In lieu of a final exam, the second-year course (Practical English IV) would conclude with a "team presentation".</p>
        <p>Before creating teams, we used a tool called <a href="https://clevergroups.com/" target="_blank">Clever 
            Groups</a> to collect students' preferences about who they would like to work with.</p>
        <p>When students followed the Clever Groups link we gave them, they were asked to select their first name 
            (and an initial where necessary to distinguish between students with the same first name)
            from a list of students in the class.</p>
        <p>After a student selects their name, they see a dropdown menu containing the names of all their classmates and they are asked to choose their first preference
            (the student they most want to work with). Students can select as many preferences as they like (even zero).</p>
        <p>After all students have had an opportunity to enter their preferences, we log in to
            Clever Groups and ask the site to generate teams given certain parameters (maximum team size, number of teams, etc.). Clever Groups then uses an algorithm to identify
            the optimum allocation of students to teams (i.e., the allocation that best fits student preferences).
        </p>
        <p>We could even have triggered this team allocation in front of the students, during class, to demonstrate
            that we were not adjusting the allocation to suit our personal preferences, etc.
